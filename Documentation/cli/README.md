## args
Print function arguments.

## break

## call
Resumes process, injecting a function call (EXPERIMENTAL!!!)
	
	call [-unsafe] <function call expression>
	
Current limitations:
- only pointers to stack-allocated objects can be passed as argument.
- only some automatic type conversions are supported.
- functions can only be called on running goroutines that are not
  executing the runtime.
- the current goroutine needs to have at least 256 bytes of free space on
  the stack.
- functions can only be called when the goroutine is stopped at a safe
  point.
- calling a function will resume execution of all goroutines.
- only supported on linux's native backend.

## goroutines
List program goroutines.

	goroutines [-u (default: user location)|-r (runtime location)|-g (go statement location)|-s (start location)] [ -t (stack trace)]

Print out info for every goroutine. The flag controls what information is shown along with each goroutine:

	-u	displays location of topmost stackframe in user code
	-r	displays location of topmost stackframe (including frames inside private runtime functions)
	-g	displays location of go instruction that created the goroutine
	-s	displays location of the start function
	-t	displays stack trace of goroutine

If no flag is specified the default is -u.
